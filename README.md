Barefoot makes code sharing between browser and server reality. Write your application once and run it on both ends of the wire.

It builds upon the popular [Backbone.JS](http://backbonejs.org/) library and keeps its own additions as unobtrusive as possible.

Server side execution is accomplished by using [Node.JS](http://nodejs.org/) and [Express.JS](http://expressjs.com/). Once delivered to the users browser, no additional JavaScript libraries are needed when configured properly.

If you implement your views with care, your application will match the [Unobtrusive JavaScript](http://roca-style.org/#unobtrusive-javascript) principle completely.

## History of barefoot
The idea behind and the code of barefoot was initially developed as part of a ![bachelors thesis](http://hsr-ba-ajw-2013.github.io/BA/) by ![@mekanics](https://github.com/mekanics), ![@mweibel](https://github.com/mweibel) and ![@swissmanu](https://github.com/swissmanu/) during springtime 2013. We decided to decouple its logic into a distinct library early and made it available to the public here.
