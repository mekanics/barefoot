/** Title: Barefoot
 * Barefoot makes code sharing between browser and server reality. Write your
 * application once and run it on both ends of the wire.
 *
 * It builds upon the popular Backbone.JS library and keeps its own additions as
 * unobtrusive as possible.
 *
 * Server side execution is accomplished by using Node.JS and Express.JS. Once
 * delivered to the users browser, no additional JavaScript libraries are
 * needed when configured properly.
 *
 * If you implement your views with care, your client side follows the
 * "Unobtrusive JavaScript" principle
 * (http://roca-style.org/#unobtrusive-javascript) completely.
